Module 1 Mini Capstone - Vending Machine
    Group of 4 produced a console line program emulating a virtual vending machine. I added a "ta-da!" sound which is played when "toys" are dispensed from the machine.
    **Sounds only play on Windows machines due to use of System.Media SoundPlayer base class.
