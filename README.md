Module 1 Mini Capstone - Vending Machine
    Group of 4 produced a console line program emulating a virtual vending machine. I added a "ta-da!" sound which is played when "toys" are dispensed from the machine.
    **Sounds only play on Windows machines due to use of System.Media SoundPlayer base class.

Module 2 Mini Capstone - TEnmo
    Group of 4 produced a server and partial console client UI emulating TEnmo, a money transfer app. Utilizing C#, MS SQL, JSON, PostMan, integration testing, and JWT Authentication developed a RESTful API server and basic command line application that registers new users, requires login authentication, and permits and validates balance transfers.
